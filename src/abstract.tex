This paper describes Hive, a Wireless Sensor Nodes network simulator.
Hive is component based and highly scalable allowing simulations
of thousands of nodes.

It provides a standard library based on events for developing applications
for Wireless Sensor Nodes. It abstracts architecture, network protocols and
components in order to provide portability.
