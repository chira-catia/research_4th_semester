This paper describes \textit{Hive}, a Wireless Sensor Nodes Network simulator.
\textit{Hive} is component based and highly scalable allowing simulations
of thousands of nodes.

It provides a standard library based on events for developing applications
for Wireless Sensor Nodes. It abstracts architecture, network protocols and
components in order to provide portability.
