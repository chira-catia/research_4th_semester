The desing of the \textit{Hive} simulator provides an easy-to-use interface
for adding support for other protocol stacks and also for adding new types of
nodes by defining values for sensor properties such as power, CPU, resources
consumed when sending/receiving a message, etc making it a useful tool for
research purposes.
The effort needed to port \textit{Hive} simulator to another platform should
not be too big since the changes are limited to the physical platform
code-area.

There are a number of features that we want to add to the simulator such as: a
GUI in order to make it easier to use - at first limited to selecting nodes
or componet types and adding them in a 2D space and later, at a more developed phase, it could
permit to create a more realistic scenario by incorporating obstacles, natural
phenomena, etc.
