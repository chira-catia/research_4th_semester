The Hive simulate isn't yet in state where we can do testing on
it and get reliable results but we will outline our plans for 
testing it here.

\begin{itemize}
	\item API testing will be done using a simple protocol
	uses as source and destination node ids. This will be used
	for testing changes to the API as the network system will not
	have to much work to do here.
	\item Test for each of the supported protocols. Packets
	will be dumped to a file and analyzed to see if they conform
	to the specification of the protocols.
	\item Scalability. We will like to know how many nodes
	the simulator will be able to simulate. We would also
	like to do profiling on these test to see where it
	spends most of its times and if we can further improve
	\item Node complexity. We would also like to see how
	many nodes we can simulate doing complex things. This
	will be done with infinite battery and doing high network
	traffic.
\end{itemize}
