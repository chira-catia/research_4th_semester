The \textit{Hive} simulator is not yet in a state where we can do testing on
it and get reliable results but  we intend to test each of its features; here
we outline our plans for testing the simulator.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{API testing} will be done using a simple protocol
	which uses as source and destination nodes the nodes ids. This will be used
	for testing changes to the API as the network system will not
	have too much work to do for this simple protocol.
	\item The second test phase will be to \textit{test each of the
        supported protocols}. Packets
	will be dumped to a file and analyzed to see if they conform
	to the specifications of the protocols.
	\item \textit{Scalability} - We want to know how many nodes
	the simulator will be able to simulate. We also
	intend to do profiling on these tests to see where the simulator
	spends most of the time and, after investigating this, to decide if we can further improve it.
	\item \textit{Node complexity} We also want to see how
	many nodes doing complex things \textit{Hive} can simulate. This
	will be done with infinite battery and doing high network
	traffic.
\end{itemize}
