The Hive simulate isn't yet in state where we can do testing on
it and get reliable results but we will outline our plans for 
testing it here.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scalability. We will like to know how many nodes
	the simulator will be able to simulate. We would also
	like to do profiling on these test to see where it
	spends most of its times and if we can further improve
\end{itemize}
